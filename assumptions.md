### Assumptions made for Iteration 1
- UserId and QuizId are based of the array length of users and quizzes.
- A name or description update that returns an error does not count as an edit.

### Assumptions made for Iteration 2
- Discovered Russians characters cannot be used in tests
- As of 20/10/2023, Unique tokens are generated by taking the highest value of sessionId and adding 1
this may be change to using uuid in the future.
- In AdminTrashRemove, after error handling, quizIds is assumed to be a number array.
- When testing if timeLastEdited was truly updated, the timestamp was created from within the test
as opposed to within the function itself. The difference would result in a subsecond delay but should
be accounted for as a two second leeway was given.
